# MEGA-Instances
This script will help you running multiple MEGA (megasync) instances on Debian (Ubuntu, Linux Mint etc.) and Arch Linux.
Make sure megasync is NOT installed before your first use of this script (as it will download all the dependencies).
Dependencies:
  - wget
  - zenity
  - megasync

To run it open a terminal and paste
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bssec/MEGA-Instances/master/mega_instances.sh && bash mega_instances.sh
```
